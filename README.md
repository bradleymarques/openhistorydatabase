By "history", I mean a factual account (evidence-based) of humanity's past.  It involves:

+ **Events** that have happened.  These can be long or short.  Examples include the Stone Age, the formation of planet Earth, World War I, The Battle of the Somme, The Moon Landing.
+ **People** who have lived, such as Srinivasa Ramanujan, Winston Churchill, David Bowie, Shaka Zulu, etc.
+ Places - big or small (such as London, England, The Kingdom of Leon )
+ Things (such as Panzerkampfwagen Tiger Ausf. B, The Compass, A Starry Night)
+ Ideas (such as Christianity, Renaissance Philosophy)

What history is not:

For this project, history is not:

+ an interpretation of history
+ legendary tales (Santa Claus, Ragnarr Lo√∞brok, King Arthur, etc.)

### 3. Database
