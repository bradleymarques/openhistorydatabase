Open History Database
=====================

What is the Open History Database?
----------------------------------

It's all in the name:

### 1. Open

+ Any one can contribute to the project
+ The derivative data is provided under [The Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License](http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1.0/)
+ The source-code used to scrape, shape and serve the data is provided under [The MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

### 2. History

By "history", I mean a factual account (evidence-based) of humanity's past.  It involves:

+ **Events** that have happened.  These can be long or short, for example: The Stone Age; the formation of planet Earth; World War I; The Battle of the Somme; The Moon Landing; Lighbulb Invented.
+ **People**, alive or dead, such as Srinivasa Ramanujan, Winston Churchill, David Bowie, Shaka Zulu, and Queen Elizabeth I.
+ **Places**.  They can be entire regions such as Great Britain, or very specific locations, such as St Paul's Cathedral.  The places may not exist today, for example: The Kingdom of Leon or The Persian Empire.
+ **Things**: the objects of the past.  They could be specific things, such as Vincent van Gogh's *The Starry Night*, or general things such as the Panzerkampfwagen Tiger Ausf. B or the Compass.
+ **Ideas** such as Christianity, Renaissance Philosophy, Exploration, Feudalism, and so forth.

There are a number of things that, for this project, the term "history" does not mean:

+ **The interpretation of history**.  Let's stick to the agreed-upon facts.
+ **Legendary tales** and **myth**, such as Santa Claus, the tale of Ragnarr Lo√∞brok, the legend of King Arthur, and other such events, places, and people for which there is no compelling evidence.

### 3. Database

+ The data is modelled as described in the data model
